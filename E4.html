      <p>I love playing against E4, because then I can just play the Caro kan.
      It is a pretty straight forward opening, and im starting to learn how to move the pieces in certain situations.
      I am also starting to find myself in difficult predicaments. I just need more time to allow my muscle memory to kick in.
      I hope to have played 1k games before the end of the year.<!-- turn these words into a cryptic rendition. Say what you said in an interesting way. -->

          <li>They will likely continue controling the center with the natural move, D4.</li>
          <li>Chance to respond with D5</li>

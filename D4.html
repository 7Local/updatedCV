      <p>When an opponent plays Queen's pawn, I simply reply with the King's Indian.
        It is safe, realiable move set that usually leads to players at my level to blunder their opening.
        When an opponent goes full kamikaze mode just slow down and think of any piece that is being threatened.
        The position allows for swift movements in your development zone

          <li>Here is where I dont care, and continue to develop devoid of most of white's potential moves</li>

          <em>You will probably insert an E5 or D5 pawn in between these steps, depending on opponent's moves</em>
